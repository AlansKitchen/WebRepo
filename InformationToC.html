<h1>Ordering</h1>
	
<h3>Cancelations, Refunds & Returns</h3>
We're very sorry to hear that you are considering these options. Please note that we investigate all requests on an individual basis and may provide a resolution that is outside the scope of these terms in the context of fairness, i.e. the consideration of extenuating circumstances or issues not applicable to these terms.
<h4> Returns </h4>
Under normal circumstances. Alans Kitchen do not accept returns between the consumer and Alans Kitchen.
	
<h3> Order Issues</h3>
	
<h4> Resolving Order Issues</h4>
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
When placing an order you acknowledge that you have the full responsibility to inform us of any issues within a reasonable timeframe upon the execution of the order, such that we are able to replace items of order with a new item or with an item of equal value within the same day and service hours.</div>
<br>	
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
If this is not possible to execute within the same period of opening hours as defined on our sites given that it's judged  the above requirement is met, you <strong>may</strong> be elligble to recieve a discount as per individual judgement. This is not standardised and can be negociated to ensure that the consumer is happy. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
We ensure that any action of value return such as replacements, refunds and discounts are fair for both parties, taking into consideration of reasonable factors not limited to but including: delivery costs, cooking resources, time of report, and quality of food.
</div>
<br>
<h4>Deliveries</h4>
	
<p>We try our best to ensure that orders get delivered to the given address as quickly as possible limited to the service demand at that current time. Occasionally, Alans Kitchen may recieve a high-volume of orders in a given day that may influence the duration it takes to complete your order. </p>

<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
We judge the success of our delivery by giving greater weight to qualitative elements of the order with factors but not limited to temperature, spillage and quality of food delivered (as this is directly required by our HACCP food policy), rather than the time taken to deliver food. 
</div><br>
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
The time taken to deliver food is limited to Consumer Law. We ensure to our greatest extent that we reduce delays to a reasonable timely manner, given factors: <strong>distance, accuracy of delivery information, requested time of delivery</strong> and <strong>accessibility to premises</strong>. Concerns for delay should be disputed with our service team for delivery updates and information.<br>
<br>
We officially consider food to be 'cold' when the food is served at a dangerously low temperature (as defined by HACCP policy), or such that the texture of the food has irreversibly significantly changed from what is intended due to cooling down.
</div>
<h4>Dynamic Service Area</h4>
<p>Alans Kitchen operates on an ("dynamic service area"), this service area, centralised at Moreton, Wirral UK. Is subject to change daily, depending on the volume of orders and delivery capacity</p><br>
  <br>
 Therefore, under rare circumstances; orders may be rejected regardless of precedent.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
Consumers will be informed when making an order and no charges or fees are applied if they are outside of the dynamic service area, provided accurate delivery information.
</div>
<h2>Hygiene</h2>

We are fully compliant with the law concerning hygiene, retaining the responsibility to comply to the UK FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY by employing several measures to reduce illnesses and injury to consumers, legally registered.
<br><br>	
We employ standard measures outlined in our own HACCP protocol which are in line with national standards and requirements in ensuring the safety in the consumption of our food, from the sourcing of our food to the delivery end-point.
<br><br>	
Concerns with hyigene should be directed towards the Alans Kitchen support team, available on Facebook, or you can contact us through our email at Info@AlansKitchen.co.uk	
<br><br>	
It is the <strong>responsibility of the consumer to explicitly state any potential health concerns such as allergies, intolerances or compromised immune responses</strong>	when creating an order with Alans Kitchen.</div>
